# Messyger

Code to accompany <https://intuitiveexplanations.com/tech/messenger>.

**NOTE:** This is somewhat of a historical artifact, because companies
like Facebook are always changing their internal APIs, both for
legitimate optimization purposes as well as simply to keep end users
from having too much control over their digital lives. So, the current
code does not work exactly as printed without a bit of tweaking.

Updating the code would bring it out of sync with the blog post and
cause confusion, so I'm leaving it be for the moment. But, you can see
[Unzuckify](https://github.com/radian-software/unzuckify) for the code
that inspired the blog post, which I am keeping up to date (at least
for the next few years, before I drop support for Messenger entirely).

By combining Messyger and Unzuckify, and perhaps some debugging skills
of your own, I think you'll be able to get something working if you
really want to.
